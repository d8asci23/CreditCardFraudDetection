# CreditCardFraudDetection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Revisit with Python

This project is a revisit project using python. I did the same project using R when I was in graduate school. At that time, I and my group member performed undersampling method to resolve the extreamly imbalanced dataset. We sampled unfraud data (column class) with the same amount of fraud data (meaning 1:1 ratio) first and then did other ratio like 1:10. The model performances were campared for the conclusion).

Later, when converting from R into Python as my main programming language, I read about SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling). The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset is already famous to use and practice SMOTE so I decided to revisit the project and prcatice oversampling.
